[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bitfinexcom/bfx-hf-chart.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/bitfinexcom/bfx-hf-chart)

This is the official Bitfinex financial charting library, released as part of the Honey Framework. It renders entirely on HTML5 canvas elements, and supports all Honey Framework trading indicators.

### Features
* 100% canvas rendering
* 100% Honey Framework indicator coverage
* High-performance with large datasets
* React wrapper component
* Fully customizable

### Installation

```bash
npm i --save bfx-hf-chart
```

### Quickstart & Example

To get started, utilize the React component to render & pass data to the chart:

```js
import React from 'react'
import BFXChart from '../dist/components/Chart/Chart'

const DATA = [....]

export default class Demo extends React.PureComponent {
  render () {
    return (
      <BFXChart
        candles={DATA}
        candleWidth='1m'
        width={800}
        height={600}
      />
    )
  }
}
```

Note that candle data is expected in Bitfinex array format, specifically:
```js
const data = [[
  mts,
  open,
  close,
  high,
  low,
  volume,
], ...]
```
